# TASK 5

### About
This program accepts a GitHub username as argument and uses GraphQL embedded in Javascript to send a 
query to the GitHub API. The program then returns the details of that user. If no such user exists, 
the same message is conveyed on the display.

### Blockers
I have not been able to fully complete the program as I could not figure out a way to implement graphQL 
in the javascript program along with the required authorization of GitHub's Personal Access Token.
