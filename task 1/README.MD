# TASK 1

### About

This task required us to run an automated script to star many repositories on GitHub. Unfortunately, 
after successfully running the program, this account got flagged. On contacting GitHub support. 
The reason for the account being flagged was this automated script. I contacted my amFOSS mentor, 
who advised me to unstar the repositories.
