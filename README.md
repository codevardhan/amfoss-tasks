THIS IS A PYTHON SCRIPT THAT READS A PNG FILE CONTAINING A CAPTHA AND RETURNS THE ANSWER.

This script uses the pip library Pillow and tesseract.

Tesseract:
Tesseract is an optical character recognition engine for various operating systems.
It is free software, released under the Apache License, Version 2.0, and development has been sponsored by Google since 2006.

After processing the PNG file with Tesseract, the program uses relatively simple script to find the answer of the required operation.
