# TASK 2

### About

This task includes 10 assignments that tests our basic programming knowledge. 
I have used python for all the problems as that is the language I'm most comfortable in.
Most of the questions were pretty straightforward and I have encountered similar questions 
while I was studying C++ in 12th grade at school.

Only the last question from Hackerrank was a bit challenging, 
and I'm pretty sure there is an easier solution to the problem.

I couldn't do the first question from CodeForces as I'm not sure about the logic of the question.
