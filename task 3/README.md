# TASK 3
### About
This is a web scraper program designed with ruby. The program scrapes google search and returns the top 10 
search results for the keyword "linux". The ruby program uses Nokogiri and open-uri gem.  
   
   
Nokogiri (é‹¸) is an HTML, XML, SAX, and Reader parser.
Among Nokogiri's many features is the ability to search documents via XPath or CSS3 selectors.

### Blockers
I am not able to process the data returned by Nokogiri to prodice a meaningful output.
