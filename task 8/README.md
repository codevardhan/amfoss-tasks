THIS IS A PYTHON SCRIPT THAT READS A ELEMENTARY PNG CAPTCHA (MATHEMATICAL OPERATION) AND RETURNS THE VALUE

This script uses Pillow and tesseract for processing the image.

Tesseract:

Tesseract is an optical character recognition engine for various operating systems.
It is free software, released under the Apache License, Version 2.0, and development has been sponsored by Google since 2006.


After processing the text in the image, relatively elementary methods are used to get the result which is then printed.
